# Fake News Classification Using Machine Learning Models
Today, we live in a world of mis-information and fake news. The goal of this project is to detect fake news using machine learning classification models **(Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine and others)**.
Fake news detector is crucial for companies and media to automatically predict whether circulating news is fake or not. I will analyze thousands of news text to detect if it is fake or not.

# Findings
1. **Naive Bayes Classifier:** 93.44%
2. **Decision Tree Classifier:** 99.49%
3. **Support Vector Machine Classifier:** 99.09%
4. **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN):** 86.95%
5. **Logistic Regression Classifier:** 98.49%
6. **Random Forest Classifier:** 99.04%
7. **XGBoost Classifier:** 99.60%
8. **LightGBM Classifier:** 99.72%
9. **AdaBoost Classifier:** 99.52%

In conclusion, the machine learning classification models performed well. We received accuracy rate more than 90% except K-Nearest Neighbors. Almost all of the models have closer accuracy score to each other. LightGBM Classifier gave the highest accuracy score (99.7%).
